     *
     * This enumeration defines the possible delivery status codes that can be
     * returned in the Transmit Status frame (0x89) by the XBee module. These codes
     * indicate the result of a data transmission, helping to determine whether the
     * transmission was successful or if an error occurred.
     *
     * The status codes can be used to troubleshoot issues in communication by
     * identifying the specific reason for a transmission failure.
     *
     * @var XBEE_DELIVERY_STATUS_SUCCESS
     *     Indicates that the transmission was successful. The packet was delivered to
     *     the intended recipient without any errors.
     * @var XBEE_DELIVERY_STATUS_NO_ACK
     *     Indicates that no acknowledgment was received from the recipient. This
     *     typically means that the packet was not successfully received or acknowledged.
     * @var XBEE_DELIVERY_STATUS_CCA_FAILURE
     *     Indicates a Clear Channel Assessment (CCA) failure. The XBee module was
     *     unable to transmit because the channel was not clear (e.g., due to interference).
     * @var XBEE_DELIVERY_STATUS_PURGED
     *     Indicates that the transmission was purged from the queue and not sent. This
     *     may occur if the module was unable to transmit the packet within the allowed
     *     timeframe.
     * @var XBEE_DELIVERY_STATUS_INVALID_DEST
     *     Indicates that the destination endpoint was invalid. The packet could not be
     *     delivered because the specified destination was not valid.
     * @var XBEE_DELIVERY_STATUS_NET_ACK_FAILURE
     *     Indicates a network acknowledgment failure. The packet was not acknowledged
     *     at the network level, suggesting that it was not delivered successfully.
     * @var XBEE_DELIVERY_STATUS_NOT_JOINED
     *     Indicates that the module is not joined to a network. Transmission failed
     *     because the XBee module is not part of a network.
     * @var XBEE_DELIVERY_STATUS_SELF_ADDRESSED
     *     Indicates that the transmission was attempted to the module's own address,
     *     which is not allowed.
     * @var XBEE_DELIVERY_STATUS_ADDRESS_NOT_FOUND
     *     Indicates that the destination address was not found. The XBee module could
     *     not find the specified address in the network.
     * @var XBEE_DELIVERY_STATUS_ROUTE_NOT_FOUND
     *     Indicates that no route to the destination was found. The module could not
     *     find a valid path to the destination address within the network.
     * @var XBEE_DELIVERY_STATUS_PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE
     *     Indicates that the payload was too large for transmission. The size of the

     *
     * This structure is used to represent an XBee API frame, which is a structured data packet
     * exchanged between the host (e.g., microcontroller) and the XBee module. An API frame
     * contains a specific type, a length field, a checksum for data integrity, and the actual
     * frame data.
     *
     * XBee API frames are used for various communication tasks, including sending commands,
     * transmitting data, receiving status information, and controlling IO pins. Each field
     * in this structure serves a specific purpose in constructing and interpreting these frames.
     *
     * @var xbee_api_frame_t::type
     *     The type of the API frame, represented by the `xbee_api_frame_type_t` enumeration.
     *     This field indicates the purpose of the frame, such as whether it is an AT command,
     *     a data transmission, or a status report.
     * @var xbee_api_frame_t::length
     *     The length of the frame data, excluding the start delimiter, length bytes, and checksum.
     *     This field specifies the size of the data portion of the frame, helping in parsing and
     *     processing the frame.
     * @var xbee_api_frame_t::checksum
     *     The checksum of the API frame, used to verify the integrity of the frame data.
     *     The checksum is calculated over the frame's data and is essential for detecting
     *     transmission errors.
     * @var xbee_api_frame_t::data
     *     The actual data contained within the API frame. This array holds the payload or
     *     command data associated with the frame type. The size of this array is defined by
     *     `XBEE_MAX_FRAME_DATA_SIZE`, which should be set according to the maximum expected
     *     frame size in the application.
     *
     * Example Usage:
     * @code
     * xbee_api_frame_t frame;
     * frame.type = XBEE_API_TYPE_TX_REQUEST;
     * frame.length = 10;
     * frame.data[0] = 0x01; // Example payload data
     * frame.checksum = calculateChecksum(frame.data, frame.length);
